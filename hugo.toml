This is **Shurang Wu**.  

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, 
advised by Professor Vijay Chidambaram. 
My research focuses on operating system reliability.  

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2025. 
In 2024, I also served as a student intern at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
working on the correctness of the Kubernetes schedulerâ€™s design and implementation under the guidance of [Professor Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/).  

You can find my CV [here](https://odeinjul.github.io/CV_2024.pdf).
